# Introduction
***
</br>

This is my digital garden :deciduous_tree:, a place for me to document things interesting to me. 


## About Me
***
</br>

I am a sophmore at the Unversity of Michigan studying data science and computer science. I am a lover of all tech, but especially blockchain and decentralization. Web3 is coming and I am excited to being a part of the growing developers moving to decentralized products.

## Purpose
***
The purpose of this site is simple; to allow me to archive and track my thouhts, ntoes, and other content that I find meaningful. The site is a mix of ntoes for my own personal reference as well as guides and externals links I have found helpful / interesting over time.  My goal in the creation of this site is to create a system simple enough for me to want to use but sophicasted enough as providing me a clear mechanism to find and archive content.

## Tech
***
This site is currently using Hugo, a static cite generator to generate the site, as well as Katex to render Latex. One of my goals in making this was trying to continue to use ipfs in terms of hosting. While I originally was planning to using the pin service pinata with ENS to host this site, I ended up discovering fleek which helped solve most of the weak spots of the system. Fleek simply allows my site to be updated by automatically pinning to IPFS and updating the connection to the domain by committing to github. Using fleek has greatly simplified the process of updating the site and led me to simply update my site to see live changes.  Going forward as fleek develops I may make alterations to the hosting. I am still in the early stages of finding a markdown set up that works best for me as I am currently using an bash alias to launch my typesetting environment from ubuntu.
