# Notes

- [Elanor Cryptography PHD substack](Inor.substack.com)  

- BIP32 Builds a binary tree of deterministic wallet addresses from a single key seed. 
- BIP39: The implementation of a mnemonic cod or sentence for the generation of deterministic wallets, consists of generating a mnemonic, as well as converting it into a binary seed which then uses BIP-0032 to make a binary tree to be used to create a host of deterministic wallets.
