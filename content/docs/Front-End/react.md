## Notes

### Environment
 Two common ways to start Create-react-app and a javascript bundler like webpack.
 Create-react-app is the more common pathway for beginning. Both use npm and node.js

 A javascript bundler combined all your javascript sources files into a single file you can then attach in the scripts of a html page. Webpack is one such example of a bundler.

 ```
 npx create-react-app 
 ```
