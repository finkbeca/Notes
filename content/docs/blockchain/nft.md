## Notes
-Openzeppelin Counter contract is beneficial when you are trying to safely increment tokenIds.   
-ERC-721 metadata is built into ERC-721   
-Link the coin to a  metadata json folder not directly to an image. This makes many attributes much easier to handle. Can use ipfs to easily hash this.
