- DAO Canvas (Business Plan to determine how a DAO should be made)

Note: We want to make a for profit DAO this relies on taxing or some form of monetization to people in or not in the DAO who are using a service provided by the DAO, this could be a tool, knowledge, etc.

- For Profit relies on funding coming in to the DAO and to a central bank where it then distributed or kept by the DAO
- Componnets
    1. Central DAO register( Allows voting , adding etc )
    2. Contract in control of voting
    3. What do people vote with? We need token.
    4. A bank in the form of a contract
    5. upgradability? dtl
    6. wrappers

    # For Profit DAO

    ## Examples:

    ---

    The LAO

    MetaCartel Ventures

    ## Model Example

    ---

    An example of a for-profit dao and some the requirements needed.

    1. Money to pay developers
    2. Open participation in providing liquidity and earning yield
    3. long term upsides for founders

    ### Steps:

    1. Compile group of parties prior to dao launch , and launch dao with them as members
    2. Require deposits and issue shares as see fit
    3. Scope product and get quotes from developers
    4. Dao picks dev and approves proposal to pay for work, could be funds from treasury, shares, etc.
    5. Product is build and launched. The liquidity pool are only made from the DAO to start. This guarantees the early yield but is also a safety measure
    6. A predetermined time or event marks the removal of the liquidity pool contribution limits
    7. All non-DAO contributions are issued with a small tax. 

    ### Notes:

    Taxes incentives long term liquidity, immediately deposition and withdrawing would net a loss.  **Timing is everything**, careful planning is needed to make sure that good traction is got before the liquidity pool is open that way there is a "moat" of sorts against a forked 0-taxed version.
