# Logic Notes

A word token is a physical thing , a string of pencil marks, illuminated pixels, etc.  
A word type is an abstract object with no size or duration. Its istances are word tokens and have some length but the type itself does not. An example of this is the sentence "Alice's word is smudged" the word that is smudged is an example of a word token while the word being produced is a word type.  
Similarly a sentence type are abstract objects. There instances are sentence tokens which do have length and size and are made of an arragnment of information in some physical context  
One sentence type can be used to express different propositions, depending on the context of utterance. Generally, Identify propositions with sentence type.  
Proposition:a claim about how things are; it represent the world in some way. It is true if things are the way it represents.  
Propositions are claims about the word; expressed by setences uttered in context but are not identical with sentence types or tokens.  
Argument: a sequence of propositions. We call the last proposition in an argument the conclusion.  
We identify the conclusion as the proposition that the speaker is trying to establish -- to give reason for -- and the premises as the reason given to support the conlsuion.  
Conclusions in ordinary reasoning incude "therefore", "hence", "thus", "so" and "it follows". Phrases that commonly indicate premises include "because", "since" and "given that".  
We count any sequence of one or more propositions as an argument. 
When it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false we call this necessary truth preservation (NTP) and we can call an argument with this property property necessarily truth preserving (NTP).  
If an argument is NTP by virtue of its form or structure we call it valid and we say that the conlsuion is a logical consequence of the premises. There are two aspects to validity:  
1. Premises cannot be true while the conclusion is false (NTP)  
2. The form or structure of the argument guarantees that it is NTP.  
Truth of premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. It only makes the conclusion highly probable.
An argument is valid if it is NTP by virtue of its form and the goal of finding a method of assesing arguments for validity that can be applied to any argument, no matter what its subject matter.  
We say an argument is sound if it is valid and in addition has premises that are in fact true. (sound = valid + all premises true).  
We say an argument is valid if its strcture guarantees that it is a NTP.  
We divide propositions into two kinds:
1. Basic propositions: propositions having no parts that are themselves propositions.  
2. compound propositions: propositions made up from other proposition and connectives.  
### Connectives: Negation, Conjunctions, Disjunctions, Conditional, Biconditional 
A connective is truth functional if it has the property that the truth or falsity of a compound proposition formed from the connective and some other propositions is completed determined by the truth of falsity  of those component propositions.
negation: if the negand is true, the negation is false and vise versa.  
negation is a truth-functional connective.  
conjunction and disjunction are both truth functional connectives: to know whether a disjunction/conjunction is true or false you need only know whether the disjucts are true or false.  
A conditional proposition of this form has two components and claims that if one is true then the other is true too. We call the formed the antecedent and the latter component the consequent. The compound proposition is known as a conditional.  
The consequent is the component that might be true even if the other component is not true; the antecedent is the component that cannt be true without the other components also being true. 
## Language of Propositional Logic 
Glossarys can be used to denote between PL and English. Though this glossary does not have to be use in forever but can be changed. 
The sentences of PL are called Wffs (Well Formed Formulas).
