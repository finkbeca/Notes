## Notes

Notes are from [Naive Set Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/558194.Naive_Set_Theory?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=VlbfdVrLSK&rank=1)  

- "naive" and "axiomatic" are contrasting words  
- Naive set thoery is axiopmatic in that some axioms for set theory are stated and used as teh basis of all subsequent proofs. However is naive that the language and notations are informal and axioms being brief and based of clear logical relations
- **Axiom of Extension** Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements  
- The wording of the axiom of extension states that a set must be included in itself this relation can be thought of reflexive  
- Given A and B if {{<katex>}} A \subset B {{</katex>}} and {{<katex>}}A \neq B {{</katex>}} the word proper is used.  
- Given a set A, B, C if {{<katex>}} A /subset B {{</katex>}} and {{<katex>}} B \subset C \implies A \subset C {{</katex>}}. Thus set inclusion is transitive.  
- Given a set A, B if {{<katex>}} A \subset B {{</katex>}} and {{<katex>}} B \subset A {{</katex>}} then {{<katex>}}A = B {{</katex>}}. Thus set inclusion is antisymmetric. Set inclusion is also sysmmetric.   
- belonging = {{<katex>}}\in {{</katex>}} and inclusion = ({{<katex>}} \subset{{</katex>}})  
Note: inclusion is transitive  
- Two basic type of sentences, {{<katex>}}x \in A {{</katex>}} and {{<katex>}} A = B {{</katex>}}  
- **Axiom of specification**: To every set A and to every condition S(x) there corresponds a set B whose elements are exactly those x of A for which S(x) holds.
