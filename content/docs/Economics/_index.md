## Notes

- Signaling Equilibrium
- Two Factor Markets (ce. Craiglist buyers rely on sellers ; sellers rely on buyers)
- Nash Equilibrium is the change of state when everyone make thier best moves from the previous nash equilibrium
- Pareto Optimum a state where it is impossible to make any change where one agent is better without making any other agents worse off
- Coordination Problem (Everyone would be better off to switch but if one person goes it is ueseless)
-Asymmetric information (Information where there is not validity to truth [asking if a car is a lemon; you can't trust the response even if they say no])
- Inferior Equilibrium (No one player acting poorly but the system as a whole)
- Signaling Equilibrium (A two factor market where 1 point is stabalaized by two seperate factors [Ivy Schools because students want to go there for high paying jobsl Ivy Schools because employers know only the smart people go there])
- Regulatory Capture of occupational liscensing 
- Gell-mann Amnesia Effects
